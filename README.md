## Note Taker Starter Code

## Summary

My motivation was to build a front and back end application. I built this project to create an application to create and manage notes. This application solves the problem of creating a place to store and create notes. I learned how to create a front and back end application as well as how to create fetch requests.

## Usage

Users may create notes in the right-hand column and click the save button, which appears after text has been entered. Created notes will appear in the left-hand column. Users may click the delete button to delete a note.

Screenshots:

Image1 shows the buttons being hidden before text has been entered.

Image2 shows the delete button functionality.

Image3 shows that the buttons appear once text is entered.
